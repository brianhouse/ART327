# ART 327 SPECIAL TOPICS: SOUND ART

Tuesday / Thursday 1:00–3:30PM, Fields 205 and [https://zoom.us/my/digitalmediastudio](https://zoom.us/my/digitalmediastudio)  
Course materials on [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/u/0/c/MTE4NTU1MDI3MTIz)

Office hours by appointment


## Course Description
This course explores sound as a medium of art-making with a rich history and radical potential within contemporary culture. Techniques covered will include non-musical scores, field recording, basic computer-based audio manipulation, and building lo-fi electronics for experimental sound synthesis. Accompanying readings draw from acoustic ecology, critical sound studies, afro-futurism, and media theory to contextualize collective exploration. Students will be expected to create studio-based art for critique. No musical experience is required.


#### Objectives:
- Cultivate an ability to think abstractly in terms of algorithms
- Understand the underlying structures of contemporary digital tools
- Survey contemporary artists working formally with code and digital media
- Build a foundation for expanding into other areas of media art practice
- Gain proficiency programming in the Python programming language


## Assignments and Grading

### Sketches
This course is built around open-ended code "sketches" that progress through a series of formal qualities associated with digital media: **algorithm**, **encoding**, **indeterminacy**, **nonlinearity**, **recombination**, **interface**, **emergence**, and **glitch**. In addition, each sketch introduces and makes use of a new programming topic, such as the use of variables and loops. We will begin each one during class time, and you will (usually) complete them as homework. All work will be submit online through [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/u/0/c/MTE4NTU1MDI3MTIz) in the form specified by the assignment. Sketches must include a title and a [3-sentence description](resources/description_guidelines.md) and will be [critiqued](resources/crit_guidelines.md) during class.

Sketches cumulatively account for 90% of your final grade. In order to receive credit for your sketch, you must upload it *before* the class when it is due—no late work is accepted, as it will be graded during the crit. Sketches will be evaluated on both concept and craft.

### Survey presentations
Each student will give a 10-minute presentation on an artist working in digital media. These presentations, which must be organized in slides, should give an overview of the context in which the artist is working and then precede to show one or two artworks in detail. Students should comment thoughtfully on how the work relates to the themes discussed in class as well as to their own practices. The presentation should end with a couple of questions posed to the class for discussion that relate to the technique or themes of the artist's work. Students will [sign up to present](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nggDB1bS2JwEHQEd68H1AvLbPs22qDmSZV5r_P9cJYI/edit#gid=0) on an artist chosen from [a list](resources/digital_media_artists.md) on a first-come, first-served basis. These presentations make up 10% of your final grade.


### COVID-19 Alterations
This course will be entirely online for Fall 2020 to provide a consistent experience and accommodate immunocompromised members of the community.


## Policies

### Values
It is my intent to lead a course that serves students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and that our varied life experiences may be a common benefit. Content in this studio art course may at times challenge our aesthetic and/or ethical values; free exchange of ideas and critique is encouraged and expected, but harassment and disrespect will not be tolerated. During class discussion and critique we aim to be mindful and generous in our interactions and to make everyone feel heard.

### Dynamic Syllabus
The version of this syllabus posted online will be updated periodically and is the definitive version. It is your responsibility to consult it and stay up-to-date.

### Laptop Use
Work for this course should be done on a personal laptop—recent hardware and MacOS is preferred (Windows and Linux are also fine; Chromebooks will not work). If you do not have access to a laptop, email me and we will make arrangements for you to borrow a machine.

### Open Studio
All students must complete their own work but are encouraged to help each other. To facilitate collective learning, students are encouraged to work in Fields 205.

### Course Fee
There is a course fee automatically paid through student accounts when registered for this class. The fee helps cover software licensing and sensor hardware. However, open source software will be used whenever possible.

### Accommodations
If you have a disability that may impact your academic performance, you may request accommodations by submitting documentation  to the Student Support Services Office in Albany Quadrangle (x7192). Staff in the SSSO will notify me of the accommodations for which you are eligible; please also make an appointment to discuss with me personally.  

### Academic Integrity
Please refer to the policy on [Academic Integrity](https://docs.lclark.edu/undergraduate/policiesprocedures/academicintegrity/) available on the College's 'Policies and Procedures' webpage. The work submitted in Digital Media courses must be conceived of and programmed by you. While learning from and incorporating code from other sources is a natural part of programming (e.g. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org)), you must demonstrate understanding and intentionality in your work, and you may not copy and paste others' code wholesale. Always credit your inspirations and be confident in your original concepts.

### Land Acknowledgement
The Fields Art Center is built on land belonging to the Multnomah, Kathlamet, Clackamas, Tumwater, Watalala bands of the Chinook, the Tualatin Kalapuya, and other indigenous nations of the Columbia River, and we are here because of the sacrifices forced upon them. Furthermore, we are at an institution named after white colonizers in a city with a racist history. As artists working in Digital Media, we must be aware of and resist the many ways computation capitalizes upon and perpetuates violence toward marginalized people.
