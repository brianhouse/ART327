# Systems

Drawing from the readings and discussion of synthesis, ambient music, sampling/remix, glitch, and noise, develop a system in Pd that creates or manipulates audio according to your own aesthetic and/or conceptual purpose. Your piece must have a title and a [3-sentence artist statement](../resources/statement_guidelines.md) that articulates your approach, and you should be able to justify your choices in critique.

The final piece can be any length (including infinite), but we will only critique two minutes in class. Upload your final piece as a 320kbps MP3. You will need to use Audacity to convert output from Pd into an MP3. You may also use Audacity to fade your track in and out and even perform additional editing if you want to clean it up, but do not do any multi-track arranging or add elaborate effects.

In addition to the audio file, include a screenshot of the patch, the .pd file, and any audio samples that it uses.
