### fixes

really need to cover spatial aspects of listening in the acoustics section, how the ear filters. etc.

recording lecture needs more A/V

it's not just about self-noise, it's about room tone

all their initial recordings are going to be too distant, because we've been doing far away listening

add screenshots to lecture notes so they can properly review

sequencing -> arranging


### new

using casettes / magnetic tape -- preexisting tapes, or record onto tape? need old hardware
