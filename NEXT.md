### fixes

really need to cover spatial aspects of listening in the acoustics section, how the ear filters. etc.

recording lecture needs more A/V

it's not just about self-noise, it's about room tone
ie, still talk about self-noise, but the exercise is "noise floor"

all their initial recordings are going to be too distant, because we've been doing far away listening --> have a "close listening" exercise? with the mic?

add screenshots to lecture notes so they can properly review

sequencing -> arranging

listening to 1-3 in class was great, but didnt have a Kubisch discussion (might not be a issue with all in-person class (though will have to rotate with the soldering stations))

have a 3Cs rubric?

feels like maybe too much time on soundscape-type stuff? we'll see. maybe thats what gets reduced to play with tape.

future: assign particular presentations on pieces
cardiff, cage, lucier, etc. might be more productive then letting them pick in terms of covering the basics

### new

using casettes / magnetic tape -- preexisting tapes, or record onto tape? need old hardware
