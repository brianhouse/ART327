### fixes

really need to cover spatial aspects of listening in the acoustics section, how the ear filters. etc.

recording lecture needs more A/V

it's not just about self-noise, it's about room tone
ie, still talk about self-noise, but the exercise is "noise floor"

all their initial recordings are going to be too distant, because we've been doing far away listening --> have a "close listening" exercise? with the mic?

add screenshots to lecture notes so they can properly review

sequencing -> arranging (and then real-time sequencing can just be sequencing)

listening to 1-3 in class was great, but didnt have a Kubisch discussion (might not be a issue with all in-person class (though will have to rotate with the soldering stations))

have a 3Cs rubric?

feels like maybe too much time on soundscape-type stuff? we'll see. maybe thats what gets reduced to play with tape. (or maybe tape comes later in the speaker section)

future: assign particular presentations on pieces
cardiff, cage, lucier, etc. might be more productive then letting them pick in terms of covering the "canon"

clip~ and distortion should come earlier

need to cover "delay" in sequencing. move it out of the live_input part

"sample manipulation" -> "sampling"

"sensors"
"speakers"

replace `dac~` with `output~` in synthesis lecture

For future, listen to all the exercises, but just play them all in a row without commentary or critique. If it's 1 minute, that's just 13 minutes. make them 30s, and you've got just 8 minutes. that's worth doing. can follow that with a few followups for students that have questions for other students.

emphasize `loadbang` earlier

missing help files for some objects

"phase" should be talked about in the acoustics section

add comport install to sensors lecture

most importantly, I think more more more examples.


### new

using casettes / magnetic tape -- preexisting tapes, or record onto tape? need old hardware


2) For those of you that still cannot load .m4a files into Audacity, you'll need to install the FFMPEG libraries for Mac (https://lame.buanzo.org/lame_64bit_osx.pkg) or PC (https://lame.buanzo.org/ffmpeg-win-2.2.2.zip). Do this and then restart Audacity, and the import should work. If not, let me know and we can work through it during office hours.

does the Cox Sound Art essay fit somewhere? in the beginning?
