### fixes

really need to cover spatial aspects of listening in the acoustics section, how the ear filters. etc.

recording lecture needs more A/V

it's not just about self-noise, it's about room tone

all their initial recordings are going to be too distant, because we've been doing far away listening

add screenshots to lecture notes so they can properly review


### new

I think using casettes / magnetic tape would be awesome. what would that take? preexisting tapes, or record onto tape?
