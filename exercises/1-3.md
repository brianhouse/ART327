# Sequencing

Create a 15 second audio piece that utilizes layered audio clips, amplitude envelopes, stereo positioning and movement, and effects to create an immersive environment.

Turn in an MP3 (320kbps, joint stereo) on Classroom, as well as a screenshot of your Audacity project while zoomed out to see all of the audio.

If you need to, you can review lecture notes [here](../lectures/05_sequencing.md)
