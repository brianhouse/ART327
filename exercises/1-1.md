# Make a recording

Find a site to record (it doesn't have to be the same as the site you used for your soundmap project) and record it. You'll want to make sure to have a mixture of background and foreground sounds with some discrete sound events. Your recording should be around 5 minutes long.

Repeat this exercise several times, but just turn in your favorite recording.

_In addition_, make a "silent" recording of the recorder's self-noise at the same gain you used to make your recording (you do not need to turn this in).


### Recording checklist
- set the recorder to a 48 kHz sampling rate and a 24-bit bit-depth
- set the format to WAV
- remember that you're working with stereo omnidirectional mics
- position the recorder with attention to distance and to reflection, absorbtion, diffusion, refraction
- use a windscreen if necessary
- preview the sound in your headphones
- set the gain (in decibels): not too soft, not peaking
- record
- make a note of the gain level that you used
