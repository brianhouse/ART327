# Make a recording

### Review

First [review information](../lectures/03_recording.md) on digital recording (and basic instructions on the use of the DR-05X).

The full manual for the recorder is [here](media/tascam_manual.pdf).

### Exercise

Find a site to record (it doesn't have to be the same as the site you used for your soundmap project) and record it from a few different perspectives for about 5 mins each time. Pay attention to how the mic placement affects the results when you listen back with headphones. Make a note of the gain ("INPUT LEVEL") you use for each recording.

Choose your favorite version to turn in on Classroom; you'll want to make sure to have a mixture of background and foreground sounds with some discrete sound events.

_In addition_, make a "silent" recording of the recorder's self-noise at the same gain you used to make your recording (you do not need to turn this in). An easy way to do this is to put the recorder under a pillow in as quiet a space as possible. You'll only need a few seconds of silence.


### Recording checklist
- Set the recorder to a WAV format with a 48 kHz _sampling rate_ and a 24-bit _bit-depth_
- Remember that your _stereo_ mics have an _omnidirectional polar pattern_
- Position the recorder with attention to distance and to _reflection_, _absorption_, _diffusion_, and _refraction_
- Use a windscreen if necessary
- Preview the sound in your headphones
- Set the _gain_: not too soft, not peaking
- Record
- Make a note of the gain setting that you used
