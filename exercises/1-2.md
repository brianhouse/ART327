# Editing

Using your recording from the last exercise (or a new one if you prefer), create a 30 second edit. The new version should sound as though it were a seamlessly recorded sound, but it should be spliced together from the most interesting parts of your recording. Address clipping and distortion, self-noise, normalization, and overall frequency response to create as clear a sound as possible.
