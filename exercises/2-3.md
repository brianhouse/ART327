# Sampler

Create a sequencer in Pd that triggers at least four audio samples that you **did not** record yourself; use Audacity to convert music, podcasts, field recordings etc into WAV files that can be loaded into `sampler~`. Automatically manipulate your samples in Pd in some way, whether it's changing the playback rate, changing the loop points of the sample, or applying changing effects.

Turn in a screenshot of the patch as well as one minute of audio.
