# Paul D. Miller (aka DJ Spooky That Subliminal Kid)

Songs of a Dead Dreamer (1996)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEmIe9YsQzo


- Born 1970, DC
- associated with "illbient"-- NYC-centered hip-hop infused ambient, kind of a sub-category of trip-hop, in the late 90s and early aughts. Collaborated all over the place.
- turntabilism -- virtuosic DJ'ing as a musical instrument
- I made his website in 1999 when I was in college, I wrote him out of the blue offering my services, and we became friends

- Paul is loved and reviled for the degree of academic theorizing he tries to pack into his writing
- but he deserves credit for acknowledging the connection between DJ'ing and postmodern theory -- this idea that everything is remix, a recombination, and that mood and feeling are the only way to negotiate it

- if modernism is that everything can be understood and composed and controlled, post-modernism blows that up into this sense of multiplicity all the time
- remember that this was written right when the web was getting started

What do you think of the writing style?
- he writes like a DJ: sampling

Some of the references that he drops:
- Marshall McLuhan, media theorist
- Deleuze and Guattari, materialist philosophers (known for their theories of nonhierarchical organization)
- Gertrude Stein, writer
- Francis Bacon, English philosopher/scientist
- Toni Morrison, African American writer
- Susan Sontag, American essayist
- KRS One, MC
- Lucy Lippard, curator
- Plato
- Comte de Lautreamont, French poet and surrealist
- Artaud, poet
- CS Pierce, semiotics
- Marx
- Massumi, Deleuze translator

Positioning DJ culture within a Western canon

/

he calls them "texts" -- ref critical theory / postmodernism
-->
- musique concret (what is it? Piere Schaeffer, Francisco LÃ³pez, sound used independently from its source)
- is that what DJs are doing?
- it's not the physical sound source that matters, but the "text" does -- what the sound means in culture, what it's referencing

[maybe, the past as a language]
