[Beneath the Forest Floor (excerpt)](media/westerkamp_beneath_the_forest_floor_excerpt.mp3) (1991)

"Beneath the Forest Floor is composed from sounds recorded in old-growth forests on British Columbia's west coast. It moves us through the visible forest, into its' shadow world, its' spirit; into that which effects our body, heart and mind when we experience forest."

- born in Germany in 1946
- emigrated to Canada when she was 22
- studied with R. Murray Schafer at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver
- as she mentions, she was one of the original DJs at Vancouver Co-operative Radio where she began to broadcast soundwalks
- has worked in the decades since as an independent artist refining this idea of soundscape composition


How did you feel about the text?


terms:
- musique concrete -- via LÃ³pez via Pierre Schaeffer, freely expressive composition with sounds separated from their sources
- acoustic ecology -- environmentalism looking for acoustic balance and working with sound as a documentary means

Maybe here is a middle way, an integration of these approaches that retains some of the ethics of acoustic ecology while giving more interpretive license

Attention to site, and also to situation, it's an argument for context

"The sonic materials bring about the essential structures and sound development of the piece"
compares it to a poem, but I think this is also very sculptural

Not just passively recording, she "plays" the materials she finds

The pieces are also opinionated.
