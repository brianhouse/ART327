[Untitled #370](https://franciscolopez.bandcamp.com/album/untitled-370) <!-- 13:30–16:00 -->
How do you feel about this piece?

- born 1964, Spain
- influenced by industrial music growing up
- also "cassette culture" -- trading mixtapes through the mail in the 80s
- trained as a biologist, and began doing field recordings in natural areas
- his pieces began to stray from documenting soundscapes into stranger territories, developed into incredibly prolific sound artist
- in his concerts, he insists on high fidelity surround sound systems, and he has the audience wear blindfolds

//

This piece is from the 90s, and is a response to Schafer's soundscape. To put it into art historical perspective, we can understand it as a postmodernist response to Schafer's modernism.

What are his two big complaints?

- on Schafer's "tuning": "The problem is that health or communication aspects are merged and confounded with aesthetic judgement"
- we've already more or less covered this critique

- on Schafer's "schizophonia": the separation of a sound from it's source is not a destructive thing, as Schafer implies, but a necessity to work artistically with sound

//

This short piece is packed with references. We know Schafer, but we also have:

- Luigi Russolo, a member of the Italian Futurist movement in the early 20th century, and author of The Art of Noises, which is a manifesto about how machines that make industrial noises should replace traditional instruments in orchestras order to embrace the possibilities of the new century
- ...Lopez is suggesting that not only humans make noise

/

- Pierre Schaeffer was a French radio engineer turned composer who is credited with being the first person to make compositions by manipulating recorded sounds, in the late 1930s. At first he used vinyl records, but he later became known for working with magnetic tape, which was invented in Nazi Germany and became widespread after WWII. He ended up inventing all kinds of machines to manipulate tape to create various effects.
- Schaeffer is associated with the terms "l’objet sonore" (sound object) and "musique concrete" (concrete music) that Lopez invokes here, which were for Schaeffer literal strands of magnetic tape that contained audio
- Sound objects are conceived of as things of themselves, and not a part of their source, which Lopez sees as diametrically opposed to the Soundscape

[Study at the Railways](media/lopez_pierre_schaffer_rail.mp3)(1948)
- Could be called "sound collage"
- Today this is integrated into sound for film, popular music production, experimental performance etc


- Michael Chion is another theorist who has supported and developed the ideas of Pierre Schaeffer, just as Barry Truax is someone who has supported the ideas of Murray Schafer, so those two get nods as well.

So the big issue is — does something become more musical the further it gets from documentary? What do you think?
